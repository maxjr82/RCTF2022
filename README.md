Welcome to the repository of the Machine Learning lecture given at the winter school
of the Réseau Français de Chimie Théorique (RCTF) held from 17-28 January 2022. This 
repository includes the slides of the lecture about "Introduction to Supervised Machine 
Learning for Chemistry" and a jupyter notebook written in Python for the practical tutorial 
section.
